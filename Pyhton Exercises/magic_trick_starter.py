# Create a variable called secret_num and set it to any number you'd like:
secret_number = 26

# Increase secret_num by 1
secret_number += 1

# Next, take the new number and double it
secret_number *= 2

# Next, take the new number and add four to it
secret_number += 4

# Next, take the new number and divide by two
secret_number /= 2

# Next, take the new number and subtract your original secret number from it
secret_number -= 26

# Print the final result
print(secret_number)
